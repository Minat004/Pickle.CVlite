            <h2>Profile</h2>
            <p>
                I have started learning programming some time ago. Currently I am working on Python, TypeScript, C# .NET
                Core and Angular 15. Still, I am open to other programming languages. I work on two projects, at the same
                time. The first project is the light and modern file manager using the Avalonia UI (WPF) cross-platform
                framework. The second one is the full stack application for generate/create CV, using Angular 15 for
                front-end, ASP.NET Core WEB API for back-end and using MongoDB like database.
